# diyECG-1opAmp
forked with minor mods

on mac:
sudo pip3 install PyQt5 
sudo pip3 install pyqtgraph
brew update
brew install portaudio
brew link --overwrite portaudio
sudo pip3 install pyaudio 



A surprisingly good ECG is possible from a single op-amp. This project contains circuit and software.

## Alternative Project (EXE)
Many people have found this python program difficult to use. A simpler program (with a click-to-run EXE you can download and run on any computer) is here:\

## Python Setup
This software needs certain libraries like PyQt4 and numpy, so the easiest way to make sure you have versions of everything that get along is to download a pre-packaged Python distribution. This software has been tested and works with WinPython 3.5.2.1 (not the Qt5 one)

* install [WinPython-64bit-3.5.2.1](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winpython/files/WinPython_3.5/3.5.2.1/) _(not the Qt5 one)_
* download this project and modify go.bat to reflect where your python.exe is
* build the circuit, plug it into your microphone hole, and run go.bat
